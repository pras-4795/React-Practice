1. React allows you to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML and Javascript (and css).
2. React follows a declarative approach for building the components.
3. Declarative means you will define the target state and let react figure out the actual javascript DOM instructions for create, update or remove.
4. Javascript uses imperative style, where we give all the instructions clearly as to what is to be done.

A Component in React is just a javascript function.<br>
Always use element names ac Capital case for custom elements, react assumes lower case elemnts are default ones.<br>

props is used to pass the parameter to a component, we have something called props.children prop to send the content within the tags.<br>
The later part is also called composition. We can also generate wrappers like Card.js using composition.
